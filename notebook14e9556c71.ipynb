Google Play Store apps and reviews\nMobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. In this notebook, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.\n\nGoogle Play logo\n\nLet's take a look at the data, which consists of two files:\n\napps.csv: contains all the details of the applications on Google Play. There are 13 features that describe a given app.\nuser_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read in dataset\nimport pandas as pd\napps_with_duplicates = pd.read_csv('datasets/apps.csv')\n# Drop duplicates from apps_with_duplicates\napps = apps_with_duplicates.drop_duplicates()\n# Print the total number of apps\nprint('Total number of apps in the dataset = ', apps.count())\n# Have a look at a random sample of 5 rows\nprint(apps.head())","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"2. Data cleaning\nData cleaning is one of the most essential subtask any data science project. Although it can be a\nvery tedious process, it's worth should never be undermined.\nBy looking at a random sample of the dataset rows (from the above task), we observe that some\nentries in the columns like Installs and Price have a few special characters (+ , $</code>) due\nto the way the numbers have been represented. This prevents the columns from\nbeing purely numeric, making it difficult to use them in subsequent future\nmathematical calculations. Ideally, as their names suggest, we would want these\ncolumns to contain only digits from [0-9].\nHence, we now proceed to clean our data. Specifically, the special characters\n\",\" and \"+\" present in \"Installs\" column and\n$ present in Price column need to be removed.\nIt is also always a good practice to print a summary of your dataframe after completing data\ncleaning.

Correcting data types\nFrom the previous task we noticed that Installs and Price were categorized as object data type\n(and not int or float) as we would like.

Exploring app categories\nWith more than 1 billion active users in 190 countries around the world, Google Play continues to be\nan important distribution platform to build a global audience.

Size and price of an app\nLet's now examine app size and app price. For size, if the mobile app is too large, it may be difficult\nand/or expensive for users to download.

Relation between app category and app price\nSo now comes the hard part. How are companies and developers supposed to make ends meet?\nWhat monetization strategies can companies use to maximize profit? The costs of apps are largely\nbased on features, complexity, and platform.\nThere are many factors to consider when selecting the right pricing strategy for your mobile app. It\nis important to consider the willingness of your customer to pay for your app. A wrong price could\nbreak the deal before the download even happens. Potential customers could be turned off by what\nthey perceive to be a shocking cost, or they might delete an app they’ve downloaded after receiving\ntoo many ads or simply not getting their money's worth.\nDifferent categories demand different price ranges. Some apps that are simple and used daily, like\nthe calculator app, should probably be kept free. However, it would make sense to charge for a\nhighly-specialized medical app that diagnoses diabetic patients. Below, we see that Medical and\nFamily apps are the most expensive.
